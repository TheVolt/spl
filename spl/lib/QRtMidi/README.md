QRtMidi
=====================

Description
-----------

This is a Qt wrapper for RtMidi.  The component is kept separate from the librarian work so it might evolve into a general purpose Qt MIDI library.
At this time, however, this is a 'first attempt' as well as contains some 'Strymon' device dependencies in the QRtSettings dialog.
