OSX Deployment Notes
====

Check if a Qt app package has been prepared for deployment by looking at the framework paths embedded in the binary.
Here's a bit of script that will do this:

> otool -L dcpl.app/Contents/MacOS/dcpl | grep -c executable_path

If 0 is returned, then macdeploy must be run.


Before an OSX application bundle can be deployed, the Qt frameworks and plugin dependancies should be copied to the bundle 
and the binary needs a bit of fix-up.  Qt comes with a tool for this.  Here's how it's run on dcpl.app.


> <path_to_qt>/Qt5.0.2/5.0.2/clang_64/bin/macdeployqt dcpl.app
